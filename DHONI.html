<h1>TRIBUTE TO MS DHONI</h1>
<img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.H9Eh9au0BLxXw7K5jIUtlwHaFj&pid=Api&P=0&w=300&h=300"  top:20px right:10opx>
<p>MS Dhoni is revered not just for his accomplishments, but for revolutionizing modern captaincy 
with his tactical brilliance and unshakable composure under pressure. His ability to read the game, 
whether it was through unorthodox field placements or strategic gambles—like giving Joginder Sharma the final over in the 2007 T20 World Cup—set him apart as a visionary leader. 
Dhoni's success transcended formats, where his adaptability in Test cricket and limited-overs made him indispensable. Beyond his explosive batting and sharp wicket-keeping, 
Dhoni's legacy is cemented by his influence on the next generation, instilling confidence, and reshaping India's approach to pressure situations.</p>
